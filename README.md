# MUST-segmenter
***MU***ltiple ***S***UV ***T***hresholding (MUST)-segmenter is a semi-automated PET image segmentation tool that enables delineation of 
multiple lesions at once, and extracts the lesions' features.

#### DEMO video
A MUST-segmenter (mini) demo video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Fib_EEHa9pA).  

#### Sample Data
If needed, a sample dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/kyliekeijzer/Slicer-PET-MUST-segmenter/tree/master/Sample%20Data).

### A. Preparation

1. [Import PET and (optional) CT DICOM series into 3D Slicer ](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/dicom.html#dicom-import)  
This can be retrieved by drag and dropping files into the DICOM database or by importing files into the DICOM database.
   - (optional) Import avoidance regions and brain contours as ***[Segmentations](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentations.html#import-an-existing-segmentation-from-volume-file)***.

2. [Load patient data into the scene](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/dicom.html#dicom-loading)  
Load ***ONE*** patient's PET (and CT) images (with or without avoidance regions and brain contours).

### B. VOI characteristics
![](screenshots/43.png?raw=true "")  
1. Create a new Point List and rename to 'VOI'  
   ![](screenshots/8.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/40.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/16.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/42.png?raw=true "")  
2. Place one seed in the desired location on the PET images  
3. Select a VOI diameter size  
4. 'Create VOI'  
5. Rename the VOI to an appropriate name (but must start with 'VOI_')  
   ![](screenshots/44.png?raw=true "")  
6. Repeat step 2 - 5 to create multiple VOIs  
7. 'Extract VOIs metrics' to save characteristics from all the VOIs

### C. Segmentation with MUST-segmenter
1. Identify tumors by seed placing (Points)  
   ![](screenshots/8.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/40.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/9.png?raw=true "")  
2. Choose segmentation method(s):  
   ![](screenshots/10.png?raw=true "")  
   - Fixed thresholds: **SUV 2.5**, **SUV 3.0** and **SUV 4.0**
   - **41% SUVmax (ROI based)**  
     a. Place regions of interest (ROIs) around the identified tumors (the seeds don't need to be removed)  
        ![](screenshots/11.png?raw=true "") &rarr;  
     (click on an image slice to initialize the annotation ROI)  
        ![](screenshots/12.png?raw=true "")  
     b. (optional) Take a threshold for each individual ROI  
        ![](screenshots/13.png?raw=true "")  
   - **41% SUVmax (seed based)**  
     - No additional steps needed
   - **A50P**  
     a. Create a VOI in the right lobe of the liver and in the right lung, as described in section A.  
     b. Rename the VOIs to 'VOI_liver' and 'VOI_lung'  
     c. *Delete* the 'VOI' Point List before segmentation!  
   - Liver-based thresholds: **Liver SUVmax**, **PERCIST** and **125% Liver SUVmean**  
     a. Create a VOI in the right lobe of the liver as described in section A.  
     b. Rename the VOI to 'VOI_liver'  
     c. *Delete* the 'VOI' Point List before segmentation!  
   - Majority Voting: **MV2** and **MV3**  
     a. Make sure the following segmentation methods are *additionally* selected, 
     or that those segmentation results are present in the scene:  
        *SUV 2.5, SUV 4.0, 41% SUVmax (ROI- or seed-based), Liver SUVmax and PERCIST*  
   - **Brain region based**  
     a. Provide or create a brain segmentation  
        ![](screenshots/22.png?raw=true "")  
     b. Rename the brain segmentation node to 'brain'  
        ![](screenshots/23.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/7.png?raw=true "")  
3. Perform segmentation and wait for the results!  
   ![](screenshots/24.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/25.png?raw=true "")

### D. Feature extraction
1. Select the segmentation results that are present in the scene  
![](screenshots/10.png?raw=true "")  
2. Compute metabolic active tumor volume (MATV) or extract more PET features  
![](screenshots/27.png?raw=true "")  
3. Files are stored at the reported location  
![](screenshots/28.png?raw=true "")

### E. Optional functionalities
1. **Remove avoidance regions from segmentation result**  
   a. Load avoidance regions as segmentations  
      ![](screenshots/30.png?raw=true "") ![](screenshots/29.png?raw=true "")  
   b. Provide the 'avoidance segmentations' node name in the input bar  
      ![](screenshots/31.png?raw=true "")  
   c. The avoidance regions will be removed from the segmentation result  
2. **Remove area outside bounding boxes**  
   Selecting this option will result in the deletion of all areas outside the provided ROIs  
   ![](screenshots/32.png?raw=true "")  
3. **Reverse images**  
   Selecting this option will reverse the PET images order when performing segmentation or PET feature extraction. 
   This may be needed if VOI metrics are inaccurate and is caused by the PET/CT being performed in the 
   opposite order.  
   ![](screenshots/14.png?raw=true "")  
4. **Edit VOIs positions**  
   If you are not satisfied with the position of the VOIs, they can be moved by the following steps:  
   a. Create and edit a new transform  
      ![](screenshots/36.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/37.png?raw=true "")  
   b. Change the position by altering the 'Translation' and 'Rotation' values  
      ![](screenshots/38.png?raw=true "")  
   c. Permanently save the position changes  
      ![](screenshots/39.png?raw=true "")
5. **Save segmentations in the desired format**  
   Before exporting to NRRD or NIFTI, the segmentation node needs to be converted to a labelmap node!

   ![](screenshots/33.png?raw=true "") &rarr; ![](screenshots/34.png?raw=true "")  
   

## 3. Notes
### Segmentation
- Make sure the PET series name contains 'pet' or 'PET'  
![](screenshots/2.png?raw=true "")  
- Make sure the brain contour is named 'brain'  
![](screenshots/7.png?raw=true "")  
- Make sure the '**VOI_liver**' is present for liver-based segmentation methods
- Make sure the '**VOI_liver**' and '**VOI_lung**' are present for the A50P segmentation method  
- Make sure only ***one*** patient is loaded into the scene  
### Feature extraction
- Make sure all segmentation results of the selected methods are present in the scene
